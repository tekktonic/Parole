What's this file about?
-----------------------
This file lists external open source projects that were the starting point of learning how to 
write a GStreamer based media player.

1) GStreamer itself, gstreamer plugins base.
2) Totem, The gnome media player.
3) Aldegonde, This tiny media player was a starting point of Totem, the code is very clear
   and minimal, ideal to read before starting.

Thanks to all the people that contributed/ing to these projects, without, Parole whouldn't be possible.
